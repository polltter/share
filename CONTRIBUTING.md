# Workflow

For each task there will be an issue in GitLab assigned to a person with the label ~"To Do". As soon as the assigned person starts the task, he must remove the ~"To Do" label and add the ~"Doing" label. After completing the task, remove the ~"Doing" label and add the ~"Review" label.

We have implemented GitLab Flow - Environment Branches. If you don't know what I'm talking about or you have doubts, I invite you to watch the videos that you find in the list below:

Basically, **for each issue a new branch must be created**. After all changes and commits are done, **a merge request must be created**.

When creating the merge request, **select Luis Coutinho in the Assignees and Reviewers fields**. The other fields, leave them with the default values.

A little tip: `git pull --prune` Â« use this command to remove from you local repository all deleted branches.
